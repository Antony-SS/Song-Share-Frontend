This project was inspired by buildspace's waveportal tutorial.  I elaborated on the idea by taking the time to learn some js and react and I am proud of how my first real javascript project turned out.

The app is pretty self explanatory.  Follow the link below to the website and go from there.

Going forwards:
I am now looking for a project that will give me some more experience and challenge on the backend smart contract side.  For this application the blockchain pretty much only worked as a server with get and post requests.  It has so much more power than that and I would like to evolve beyond that for my next project.
